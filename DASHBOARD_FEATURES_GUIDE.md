## 🚀 How to Access Full Features

### Option 1: Run Full Dashboard (Recommended for Full Features)
```bash
cd /workspaces/IoT-Predictive-Maintenance-System
python launch_full_dashboard.py
```
**Note:** Takes 60-120 seconds to load all ML services

### Option 2: Run Simple Dashboard (Recommended for Quick Access)
```bash
cd /workspaces/IoT-Predictive-Maintenance-System  
python launch_unified_dashboard.py
```
**Note:** Starts in 10 seconds, basic features only

### Option 3: Direct Access to Individual Layouts
You can test individual full-featured layouts:

```bash
# Test Anomaly Monitor (full features)
python -c "from src.presentation.dashboard.layouts.anomaly_monitor import create_layout; print('Anomaly Monitor OK')"

# Test Enhanced Forecasting
python -c "from src.presentation.dashboard.layouts.enhanced_forecasting import create_layout; print('Forecasting OK')"

# Test Maintenance Scheduler
python -c "from src.presentation.dashboard.layouts.enhanced_maintenance_scheduler import create_layout; print('Maintenance OK')"
```
